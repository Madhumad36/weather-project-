# Weather Explorer

Weather Explorer is a responsive web application that provides real-time weather information along with a short-term forecast. The project focuses on clarity, usability, and accurate data presentation while maintaining a clean and modern interface.

---

## Overview

The application allows users to search for weather details by entering a city name or an Indian state name. Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and displayed in a structured and visually intuitive manner. The interface adapts dynamically based on weather conditions to improve user experience.
